/* BRONZE

Write two variables. One will store your name and another will store a friend's name. 
Find out what property you can use to check how long the names are. Console log how 
many letters are in each name.

*/

//to create a variable, use var or let
//var is legacy
//let is hwat you should use

let amruta = "Amruta";
let paul = 'Paul';

console.log(amruta.length);
console.log(paul.length);

/* SILVER

Expand on what you have already done and write a conditional to see who has the longer 
name. Using string interpolation console log who's name is longer. 

Example Result: My name is longer than Adam's.
*/

if (amruta.length > paul.length) {
    console.log(`${ amruta } is longer than ${ paul }`);
} else {
    console.log(`${ paul } is longer than ${ amruta }`);
}

/* GOLD

In the console log include how many letters difference there are between the names.

Example Result: Adam's name is shorter than mine by 4 letters.

There is also one additional case that should be handled that has not been mentioned so 
far. See if you can add that to your conditional!
